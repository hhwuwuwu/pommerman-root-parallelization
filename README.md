# Pommerman baselines

Some baselines for Pommerman competition, see subdirectories.

The code is based in the repository:
https://github.com/tambetm/pommerman-baselines
What I do is to optimize the mcts algorithm through root-parallelization method.

1.test-noteam means the VS mode of pommerman is FFA.
test-noteam means the VS mode of pommerman is TeamCompetition.

2.bash test-noteam/all.sh
bash  test-team/all.sh
